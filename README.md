#  [Morse Mate](https://morsemate.firebaseapp.com)
#### This is the Git repository for project group 14. The Project is part of KTH course II1302 “Projekt och projektmetoder”. 

A user send a message through the `Cloud` to a `Morse` device via PC.
When the message is sent to the server, it should send a message to `Morse` device and request a verification that the recipient should do again to receive the message. This is indicated by a green light coming on. 
The receiver then presses a button that sends an OK to the server. Then the server sends the message to the Morse device which flashes and beeps.

# Morse code 
Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. [Read more on wikipedia...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code).
